     <h1><br>WE MADE ELIUD KIPCHOGE RUN IN 0:56</h1>
     <p><b>Imagine yourself having to travel abroad, and try identify as a Kenyan to the world? What tricks have you used? Let us know when you remember. For those who are in the hustler nation of Kenya, what ways do you say you are Kenyan to those who call from beyond borders on your Zoom calls? Let us know when you remember. A lot of things have been able to define Kenyan’s, from tourism to agriculture, but if it’s one person who says Kenyan’s can keep and has a good sense of time, in our hustling and bustling of the city, it’s none other than our multiple record holder and famously 1:59 record holder, who says “No human is limited”, Eliud Kipchoge.
           A national banner to the world and an inspiration for many, from here in Kenya to vast reaches of the world, Kipchoge is the epitome of discipline and keeping his stature in midst of the world stage. A career that keeps long distance marathon runners on their toes and training programs to fill shoes, should he leave the stage.
          Coming to a time in his career, where, the questions of when he will leave the stage, starts to fly in the air, Void Atelier Productions and Waxxes animation studio wished to take a stab at being able to honour the national sporting hero. Through our own ways, we were able to think about how to craft a small trailer video that would serve as a stepping stone on how to capture Kipchoge and his strong ideals for discipline and self-belief.</b></p>

<h4>Some pictures of Eliud Kipchoge</h4>
<p><b>Inspired by the greenery of the Rift Valley region, 
     we attempted to create an environment to capture the rural areas of their training and bring out the vast terrains in which the long distance runners use to sculpt their bodies for international competitions. As seen in the picture below. In addition to the environment, 
     we wanted to keep his mannerism when running intact and show the hero in his best state.</b></p>

<p><b>Our hopes to bring the national hero into animation, are still ripe and on Kiphcoge’s heels at every race he starts and finishes, for Kenyan families and the world to watch. Kipchoge’s sporting career, is something that inspires many others and should be stored in a format for others who have gotten to witness his greatness, and learn his lessons to inspire many generations.
    Back to you, my animation community, marathon runners and enthusiasts. What ways should we bring Eliud Kipchoge closer to your screens in animation? How can we bring his lessons to others to help a generation to grow? Let us know in our contacts and socials.</b></p>
  
<h1 id="njugush1"><br>NJUGUSH IS EVERYWHERE… BUT HAVE YOU SEEN HIM IN ANIMATION?!<br/></h1>
<p><b>We’ve all had that day that we would wish to delete from our lives. Either, you were at work and your boss was giving you the wrong kind of attention, trying to not relive stressful memories of a relationship or it’s those days that nothing seems to go right. As usual, if it’s the folks who can’t enough sleep at night, just flip the screen in the midst of the dark and scroll comments of those funny videos on social media to make your day.
    Among the many content creators, who splash their prowess to turn your frown upside down, it’s none other than our Kenyan household name, Njugush. From various films and TV shows, his whacky and playful type of comedy cannot be missed and his slim frame is almost recognizable by any person who has shared his videos to family and friends.
    Most of our content creators have used the phone camera and their surroundings, to make their content. It could be at the roadside with food vendors, to kiosks, farms in rural areas or even just in their bedroom. The creativity in these individuals, to make a happy moment, comes second to none. However, a rare and almost unusual medium for exploring the skills of this comedic moments or just general content has been animation.
    Upon our various daydreaming of ideas as creatives at Void Atelier Productions and Waxxes animation studio, we pounced upon the idea of making an animated video focusing on the internet. The brainstorming lasted a while looking for ideas but finally we decided we could only involve one of the most clumsy, whacky and playful Kenyan comedians we know. Njugush.
    Our video was based on the premise of Njugush having a relationship with his couch which was to surf him into the experience of having to live within the digital world while having the most blissful experience with a very accommodating internet service. The playful nature of the story helped guide us and bring out the best parts of Njugush as a character, driving him through different environments. From hustling neighbourhoods to the enchanted forest. </b></p>

  <h3><br>Njugush in the different environments<br/></h3>
  <p><br>After the release of the video, we shared it widely and posted it and all our social media for the public to see.
   All the same, in the process of sharing our video, guess who got to see it? Yes, none other than the playful comedian himself, Njugush. 
   It was a wonderful surprise, to be able to get feedback from the man himself, who was also impressed by the video and somewhat gave us a hint at what we could come with next in the same context.</p>
